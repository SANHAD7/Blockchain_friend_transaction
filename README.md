E-Aadhaar Blockchain System
A decentralized-like identity management system using blockchain principles to securely register and verify E-Aadhaar records. This project demonstrates blockchain fundamentals including immutability, hash validation, and chain integrity, while providing a user-friendly interface with Streamlit.

Key Features:

Register new Aadhaar records with validation for uniqueness, 12-digit Aadhaar, and realistic DOB.

View the entire blockchain ledger with transaction details.

Verify the blockchain for integrity, highlighting any tampered blocks with detailed error information.

Visual analytics of Aadhaar records (e.g., gender distribution).

Simulated decentralized behavior with Flask API and multiple node support.

Tech Stack:

Backend: Python, Flask

Frontend: Streamlit

Data Structure: Custom blockchain implementation with Python classes

Visualization: Plotly

Other: Requests library for API interaction

Use Case:
This project serves as a demo for secure, tamper-evident digital identity management using blockchain concepts. Ideal for learning blockchain implementation and decentralized ledger systems.
